This is a barebones implementation of zogo's new integration 360 product. api calls should go to https://api.zogo.com and the script for the integration is found at https://sdk-cdn.zogo.com/zogo-360-integration-latest.min.js

the project has some issues, please fix the following:

- Zogo isn't loading, find out why, and fix it.
- The profile icon in the top right seems to be floating up off center, fix that please.
- when zogo does load it seems to be cutting off some of the content of the integration.
